## **Notes**
- If not immediately directed to the app and instead see a loading Render page, it should start up within approximately a minute.
- In May 2025, Spotify greatly limited indie developer capabilities: only large companies with very wide active user bases and revenue are allowed to access the extended API to release apps publicly. Everyone else is limited to 25 manually specified users at a time, which is why a test account is used here.  
  If interested in using Mood DJ regularly, email **williamtzhou@gmail.com** with your Spotify email and full name, and you will be added to the user list as soon as possible. This limitation is frustrating; feel free to contact Spotify about it as well.
